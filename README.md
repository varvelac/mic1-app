# Flutter Boilerplate

This repository contains a minimal Flutter Android boilerplate. It includes:

- A `SettingsPage` that holds app state using `ChangeNotifier`.
- A `MainPage` that can read the state and navigate to the settings.

## Getting Started

1. Ensure [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install) is installed.
2. Run `flutter pub get` to fetch dependencies.
3. Launch the app with `flutter run`.
